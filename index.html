            Investing in my continuing education and maintaining a constant thirst for learning are paramount to my professional identity. I will always be eager for opportunities to obtain new skills and polish existing ones.
            Since graduating with my degrees from CU Boulder, I've tried working in retail, veterinery medicine, graphic design, banking, and most recently, IT.
            Within my company's IT department, I found myself drawn to coding.
            In August of 2022, I began study at UC Berkeley Extension's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp and will graduate in January 2023.
