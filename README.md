# Employee Portfolio

Thank you for viewing Arielle's second challenge with the UCB Coding Bootcamp!

For this assignment, we assigned the task of creating a mock portfolio site of our previous work. 
In my portfolio I have included a link to my first project with the bootcamp, and then some of my previous work from my former life as a graphic designer and web designer.

Please view the live site here:

- Smooth CSS transitions on hover
